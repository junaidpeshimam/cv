# Recognizing Bird Sounds

## Project Overview
The "Recognizing Bird Sounds" project leverages machine learning techniques to identify bird species based on their audio recordings. This system aims to assist researchers, conservationists, and bird enthusiasts by automating the recognition process.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Converts audio to a uniform format, reduces noise, and normalizes signals.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes Librosa to extract MFCCs, chroma features, and spectral contrast.
- **Model Training**: Employs SVM and CNN models for classification, fine-tuned for high accuracy.
- **Web Application**: A Flask-based interface allows users to upload audio files and get real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Flask, TensorFlow, Keras, Librosa, Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset for more diverse bird species.
- Incorporate real-time recognition capabilities.
- Explore advanced neural network models for enhanced accuracy.
